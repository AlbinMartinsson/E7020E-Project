# Embbeded Audio Effects

E7020E Embedded System Design is a course giving at Lulea University of Technology. [Link to course syllabus](https://www.ltu.se/edu/course/E70/E7020E/E7020E-Design-av-inbyggda-system-1.67927?kursView=kursplan&l=en)

The purpose of this course is to get a understanding of embedded system and applying that knowledge into designing your own system. Our group did a system that can manipulate audio (adding effects). Where giving an audio input, add some effects and then output it on a speaker.

## Getting Started

* Start by installing Rust for embedded system, follow [this](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/intro/install.html) guide. 
* Install OpenOCD (version 0.10.0)
* Install arm-none-eabi-gdb (version 8.2.1)
* We are using as of 2019-03-27: rustc 1.34.0-nightly (8a57831a4 2019-02-02)

### Building software
* Clone the repo ``` git clone https://github.com/alagerkvist/E7020E-Project.git ```
* If you would like to use the latest main program run ``` cargo build --release ```
* For examples, run ``` cargo build --example NAME_OF_RS_FILE (codec) ```

## Deployment

* Create FIFO file ``` mkfifo /tmp/itm.log ```
* Start your ITM trace ``` itmdump -f /tmp/itm.log -F ```
* Start OpenOCD ``` openocd -f openocd.cfg ```
* Start gdb ``` arm-none-eabi-gdb target/thumbv7em-none-eabinhf/debug/examples/NAME_OF_RS_FILE -x openocd.gdb ```

## Implemented features

* PWM/LED
* Button
* LCD
* Codec (ish)
* ADC

## Known issues and limitation

* MCUs adc can only read from one potentiometer
* LCD screen has no library yet, so it's a pain in the a** to write to it
* As of now, the codec is inconsistent when writing to it, possible reason to this can be impedance mismatch or wrongfully clock generation 
* PCB layout for 5V to 3.3V regulator is not right implemented
* Footprint for mini-usb type B is placed wrong, should be the other way around (no possibility to mount it on the PCB as of now)
* Codec is in master mode, and should be in slave mode (can be fixed with a pull down resistor instead of a pull up resistor)
* Layout for the potentiometer is too close, needs to seperate more
* Footprint for RCA connector needs to be bigger in their NPTH hole 

## Future work

* Implement ADC so it can be read from three potentiometers
* Library for LCD
* Successfully send data to codec
* Store data from codec into ram
* Sound processing (filter or convolution implementation)
* Store/read data on USB
